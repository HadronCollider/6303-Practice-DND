# Word memory game
  The field divided into cells, half of them filled with words of one language (for example, English) and the other half with words of another language (for example, Russian). Player needs to pick the correct pair. If pair is picked correctly, it disappears and the cells where the pair was become green. 
  Lessons are configuring by importing a text file in Unicode. The number of pairs for a lesson is unlimited: if only one part of the lesson is placed on the field then after correctly guessing this part the screen fills again, and so on until all the words of the lesson are guessed.
Errors committed by the user are saved in 2 lists that can used later as input for other lessons.
